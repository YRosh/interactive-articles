# Interactive Articles

This is a simple app using the [tiptap](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap) editor. In this project we have added a new node which is the MCQ node. With this node you can add MCQ questions and options in the edit mode and in the view mode answers can be selected. These selections are further updated in the database via API calls

### Setup

-  I have used Node.js (version 20.12.2), Next.js and Typescript for the frontend. Ensure the your npm is version 9.2.0 and if using nvm it is of version 0.39.7
-  Firstly install the necessary packages. Go into the `interactive-articles` folder and run the below command.

```
npm i
```

-  Once all the packages are installed, start the server with the below command

```
npm run dev
```
